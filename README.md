# Secure-Data-Hiding-in-Images-using-Steganography
Indroduction
The project explores hiding data in images while maintaining perceptual similarity. Our contribution is the ability to extract the data after the encoded image has been printed and photographed with a camera (these steps introduce image corruptions). This repository contains the code and pretrained models to replicate the results shown in the paper. Additionally, the repository contains the code necessary to train the encoder and decoder models.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project provides a secure and user-friendly way to encrypt and decrypt messages within images using steganography and password protection. The message is embedded inside an image using OpenCV and can only be retrieved with the correct password.
