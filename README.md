# Secure-Data-Hiding-in-Images-using-Steganography
Indroduction
The project explores hiding data in images while maintaining perceptual similarity. Our contribution is the ability to extract the data after the encoded image has been printed and photographed with a camera (these steps introduce image corruptions). This repository contains the code and pretrained models to replicate the results shown in the paper. Additionally, the repository contains the code necessary to train the encoder and decoder models.
